## About Me

### Introduction

My name is Logan, I am a recent Applied Mathematics graduate from the University of Connecticut. Along with my math coursework, I have taken additional related classes in programming and software development. I also code in my free time and have been working on projects while trying to build my knowledge in full stack development. Technologies I have been focusing on are React, Next.js, and Bootstrap on the front end along with Flask, SQLite, and REST APIs on the back end.

## Projects

There are currently two primary projects I have been working on since graduation:

### Steam With Friends
`Python, Javascript<br>
React, React Bootstrap, Flask, REST API, SQLite`

_Steam with Friends_ is a prototype full stack application, whos purpose is to recommend what games group of friends should play based on applications they share among each other's libraries. The bulk of the application is a Flask server that serves a REST API that takes in a list of users, pulls their libraries from the official [Steam API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev), and returns information that can be processed by the front end application or other users. The frontend is a React Bootstrap application that is currently in progress. It takes in a list of users and queries the server, then presents the response in a clean and concise format.

Front End Progress: ![10%](https://progress-bar.dev/10)<br>
Back End Progress: &nbsp;![80%](https://progress-bar.dev/80)

### Sort Visualizer
`Python, Pygame`

_Sort Visualizer_ is a local application that gives a visual representation of how multiple different sorting algorithms work. The main focus of this project is a custom datatype `RewindableList` that tracks changes to a list and allows those changes to be replayed forwards or backwards in a buffer.
